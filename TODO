* Infer types of variables (nullable or list)
* investigate why property declaration of `val a by b` eats up following NL, failing statements parsing.
* Finish GL plugin
* Add 'super(methodName)' production, which calls 'super.methodName'
* Add 'foreign' production, which binds another parser to a name, also, I need to figure out how to call them, since their input types can be different
  for instance, KOMeta and Kotlin parsers use Char and Token respectively
* Add 'INIT' production, in which one can list all properties of generated class (useful for scopes)
